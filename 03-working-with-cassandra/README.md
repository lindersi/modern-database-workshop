## Connecting to the Cassandra environment

### Using the Cassandra Command Line utility

You can find the `cqlsh` command line utility inside the Cassandra docker container running as part of the platform. Connect via SSH onto the Docker Host and run the following `docker exec` command

```
docker exec -ti cassandra-1 cqlsh -u cassandra -p cassandra
```

This will connect you into the `cassandra-1` container and run the `cqlsh` inside id. You should see an output similar to this one.

```sql
bigdata@bigdata:~$ docker exec -ti cassandra-1 cqlsh-u cassandra -p cassandra
Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
Recommendation: use the credentials file to securely provide the password.

Connected to "Test Cluster" at 127.0.0.1:9042
[cqlsh 6.2.0 | Cassandra 5.0.4 | CQL spec 3.4.7 | Native protocol v5]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh>
```

> **What you should see:** The `cqlsh>` prompt along with the cluster name, Cassandra version, CQL spec version, and native protocol version printed above it.

You are now at the Cassandra CQL command prompt, ready to execute CQL statements.

We can also see the actual version of Cassandra, CQL and cqlsh available to us.

Try executing the following CQL statement

```sql
SELECT * FROM system_schema.keyspaces;
```

and you should see the currently existing keyspaces as the results

```sql
cqlsh> SELECT * FROM system_schema.keyspaces;

 keyspace_name      | durable_writes | replication
--------------------+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        system_auth |           True | {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'}
      system_schema |           True |                             {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.LocalStrategy'}
 system_distributed |           True | {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '3'}
             system |           True |                             {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.LocalStrategy'}
      system_traces |           True | {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '2'}

(5 rows)
```

> **What you should see:** The five built-in system keyspaces (`system_auth`, `system_schema`, `system_distributed`, `system`, `system_traces`) listed in a table with their replication settings.

### Using browser-based GUI
Instead of working over the command line and therefore having to connect to the Docker Host via SSH, we can also use a browser based GUI to access Cassandra. Two browser-based utilities are available as part of the platform.

#### DbGate

The first one is the [DbGate](https://dbgate.io/).
In a browser window navigate to <http://dataplatform:28120/> and login in as user `dbgate` and password `abc123!`.

Click on the **Add new connection** (`+`) menu under **CONNECTIONS**. 

Select `Cassandra` for the **Connection type** and enter the following values:

 * **Local Data Center**: `se1`
 * **Server**: `cassandra-1` 
 * **User**: `cassandra`
 * **Password**: `cassandra`
 * **Display name**: `Cassandra`

![Alt Image Text](./images/dbgate.png "Cassandra Web GUI")

Click **Test** to check that connection settings are valid and then click **Connect**. 

The **Cassandra** connection will show up below **CONNECTIONS**. 

> **What you should see:** The DbGate web UI with the Cassandra connection listed under CONNECTIONS, and the keyspaces visible when the connection is expanded.

Right click on `Cassandra` connection and select **New Query (sever)** to execute a CQL statement.

#### Apache Zeppelin (this is currently not available on dataplatform)

Another universal "data" tool is [Apache Zeppelin](http://zeppelin.apache.org). In a browser window, navigate to <http://dataplatform:28080/> and you should directly arrive on the home screen as shown below.

![Alt Image Text](./images/apache-zeppelin.png "Apache Zeppelin")

Click on **Login** in the top right corner and enter `admin` into the **User Name** and `changeme` into the **Password** field. Click **Login** and the home screen should refresh to show some preinstalled notebooks.

![Alt Image Text](./images/apache-zeppelin-2.png "Apache Zeppelin")

Apache Zeppelin uses a so called "Notebook" based model that enables data-driven, interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more.

Zeppelin uses the concept of interpreters. Each Interpreter has the capability to "talk" to a given data systems. When creating a Notebook, you can specify the "default" interpreter to use, all other interpreters can be used as well, but then the directive `%<interpreter-name>` has to be used in each cell.

Zeppelin has a Cassandra interpreter, which we will use here. But before we can use it, it has to be configured. Click on **anonymous** drop-down and select **Interpreter** as shown in the image below.

![Alt Image Text](./images/apache-zeppelin-navigate-interpreter.png "Apache Zeppelin Interpreter")

Navigate to the **Cassandra** Interpreter either by searching for it or scrolling down to reach it. Click on **edit** and change the **cassandra.credentials.username** to `cassandra`,  **cassandra.credentials.password** to `cassandra` and **cassandra.host** property to `cassandra-1` (the service name of our Cassandra node in the docker-compose configuration).

![Alt Image Text](./images/apache-zeppelin-interpreter-cassandra.png "Apache Zeppelin Cassandra Interpreter")

Scroll-down to the end of the Interpreter settings and click **Save**. Confirm that you want Zeppelin to restart the Interpreter with the new settings.

Click on **Zeppelin** in the upper left corner to navigate back to the Home screen.

Now let's create a new notebook by clicking on the **Create new note** link. On the pop-up window enter `Cassandra` into the **Note Name** field and select **cassandra** for the **Default Interpreter** and click **Create**.

![Alt Image Text](./images/apache-zeppelin-create-notebook.png "Apache Zeppelin Cassandra Create Notebook")

An empty notebook with one cell will appear. This cell is now ready to be used and has the Cassandra interpreted assigned. Enter each command into a separate cell and either click on the **play** icon on the right or hit **Ctrl-Enter** to execute the cell. A new cell will automatically appear when executing the current one.

You can try it with the following statements

```sql
SELECT * FROM system_schema.keyspaces;
```
execute it and you should see the currently existing keyspaces

![Alt Image Text](./images/apache-zeppelin-cassandra.png "Apache Zeppelin Cassandra Create Notebook")

## Create a Keyspace for the Movie sample

Keyspace in Cassandra is the equivalent of database/schema in relational databases. While creating a keyspace, you need to specify replication settings.

Either use the Cassandra CLI or DbGate to execute the statements in this workshop. 

```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE movies WITH replication =
  {'class':'SimpleStrategy','replication_factor':1};
```

> **What you should see:** No error message — the keyspace is created silently.

> **What just happened?** A keyspace is Cassandra's top-level namespace, equivalent to a database schema in SQL. The replication factor controls how many nodes store copies of the data — with `replication_factor: 1` each row is stored on exactly one node.

We'll be using `SimpleStrategy` to keep things simple, because our Cassandra setup is just single node.

In a production environment, where it's usually common to have multiple datacenters, `NetworkTopologyStrategy` is generally used because it better distributes data across datacenters.

Replication factor = 1 means there will be single copy of a row on a particular node. Higher replication factors are set up in real systems for creating multiple replicas that ensures data availability in case of disk failures.

To be able to work with tables, you need to use your keyspace, as shown in the following statement:

```sql
USE movies;
```

> **What you should see:** The prompt changes from `cqlsh>` to `cqlsh:movies>` to indicate the active keyspace.

Another option is to prefix the table name with the keyspace name in all queries, similar to what you can do when referencing the schema in an RDBMS.

At any time, you can `DESCRIBE` the keyspace, use the following command to do that:

```sql
DESCRIBE KEYSPACE movies;
```

and you should see an output similar to the one shown below

```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE movies WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'}  AND durable_writes = true;
```

If you wish to list all keyspaces present in the database, a Cassandra reserve keyspace named system comes in handy. It contains many system-defined tables for database objects definition and cluster configuration. Let's list all records from the `schema_keyspaces` table that contains records for each keyspace.

Enter the following command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM system_schema.keyspaces;
```

The output of this command looks as follows:

```
 keyspace_name      | durable_writes | replication
--------------------+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        system_auth |           True | {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'}
      system_schema |           True |                             {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.LocalStrategy'}
             movies |           True | {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'}
 system_distributed |           True | {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '3'}
             system |           True |                             {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.LocalStrategy'}
      system_traces |           True | {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '2'}
```

> **What you should see:** The system keyspaces plus the newly created `movies` keyspace listed in the result table.

## Using "Static" Tables (skinny row)

### Create the Movie and Actor table

Run the following statement for creating a table called user. For those who are acquainted with SQL, the following syntax should look very familiar and almost identical. Even some of the naming conventions as well as formatting guidelines can be reused.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movies.movie;
CREATE TABLE movies.movie (movie_id int,
    title text,                // title
    release_year int,        // year
    running_time int,         // runtimes
    languages set<text>,     // language codes
    genres set<text>,          // genres
    plot_outline text,        // plot outline
   cover_url text,             // cover url
   top250_rank int,            // top 250 rank
   PRIMARY KEY (movie_id)
);
```

> **What you should see:** No error message — the table is created silently.

> **What just happened?** Cassandra tables require a PRIMARY KEY consisting of a partition key (here `movie_id`), which determines which node stores the data, and optional clustering columns that control the sort order within a partition.

This creates a first static column family (table) in Cassandra. Now do the same for the Actor table.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movies.actor;
CREATE TABLE movies.actor (actor_id int,
  name text,                    // name
  headshot_url text,        // headshot
  mini_biography text,        // mini biography
  birth_date text,            // birth date
  trade_mark list<text>,    // trade mark
  PRIMARY KEY (actor_id)
);
```

> **What you should see:** No error message — the actor table is created silently.

You can view a table metadata using the `DESCRIBE` command, as shown in the following statement

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE movie;
DESCRIBE TABLE actor;
```

### Inserting Data into Movie and Actor

In Cassandra, an INSERT operation is actually an "Upsert" (UPDATE or INSERT), which means columns are updated in case a row for the given primary key already exists, otherwise all columns are freshly inserted.

First lets add the movie "The Matrix" and "Pulp Fiction"

```sql
// insert "The Matrix" - 0133093
INSERT INTO movies.movie (movie_id, title, release_year, running_time, languages,
                   genres, plot_outline, cover_url, top250_rank)
VALUES (0133093,
        'The Matrix',

```

> **What you should see:** No output on success — Cassandra INSERT does not return a confirmation message by default.

> **What just happened?** Cassandra writes each row to the partition determined by the partition key (`movie_id`) and replicates it according to the keyspace replication factor.

Now let's also add some actors playing in these 2 movies.

Let's add the actor "Bruce Willis", "John Travolta", "Sandra Bullock", "Samuel L. Jackson", "Uma Thurman" & "Quentin Tarantino"

> **What you should see:** No output on success — Cassandra INSERT does not return a confirmation message by default.

**Note:** In the case of Quentin Tarantino we have shortend the trade marks from the original.

### Displaying Data

SELECT command lists content of a table; a filter can be applied using the WHERE clause:

```sql
SELECT movie_id, title
FROM movies.movie;
```

> **What you should see:** A result table with the `movie_id` and `title` columns for all movies currently stored.

We can also select all columns as shown here for the Actor table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies.actor;
```

> **What you should see:** All rows and columns from the actor table returned in a result table.

Result of previous SELECT queries may make you wonder, this looks so similar to RDBMS tables, is this how data is stored in Cassandra as well?

The answer to the preceding questions is—although CQL gives you a nice looking interface similar to a RDBMS you are used to, data is stored in Cassandra according to its own data-model.

Try what happens if you try to restrict on another column, such the `name` of the actor.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies.actor
WHERE name = 'Bruce Willis';
```

You can see that you get an error

```
InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] message="Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING"
```

Cassandra does not allow to restrict on another column than the primary key. Let's see if that is true. When we use the `actor_id` instead the query will work.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies.actor
WHERE actor_id = 0000246;
```

> **What you should see:** The row for Bruce Willis returned in the result table.

As hinted in the exception, you can force Cassandra to execute a restriction on a non-primary column by adding the `ALLOW FILTERING` clause.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies.actor
WHERE name = 'Bruce Willis'
ALLOW FILTERING;
```

Be careful with this all though. This is **very inefficient** for Cassandra to do and there is a good reason `ALLOW FILTERING` is not enabled by default.

### Updating data

You can use `UPDATE` to change data. As said previously, it will have the same effect as an `INSERT`.

Let's update the actor Bruce Willis and add his middle name.

```sql
UPDATE movies.actor
SET name = 'Bruce Walter Willis'
WHERE actor_id = 0000246;
```

> **What you should see:** No output.

> **What just happened?** Cassandra UPDATE is actually an upsert — it creates the row if it doesn't exist, because Cassandra uses a log-structured storage engine (LSM tree) that appends writes rather than modifying data in place.

Check the result with a `SELECT`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies.actor
WHERE actor_id = 0000246;
```

> **What you should see:** The actor row with the updated name `Bruce Walter Willis` returned in the result table.

The same could have been achieved with the following insert, just updating the email to a different value to be able to see the result.

```sql
INSERT INTO movies.actor (actor_id, name)
VALUES (0000246, 'Bruce Willis');
```

Check the result again with a `SELECT`. You can see that the `name` has been updated.

Now let's show that with an `UPDATE` we can even create a new record:

```sql
UPDATE movies.actor
SET name = 'Cool Actor'
WHERE actor_id = 99999999;
```

Check that it worked using a SELECT

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies.actor
WHERE actor_id = 99999999;
```

You can clearly see that an `INSERT` will not complain if a row already exists under a given primary key (row key). It will even update that row. A huge difference compared to RDBMS!

Be careful to always pass the right primary key value, otherwise some unexpected results might occur.

### Deleting data

Of course we can also delete data.

Data can be deleted using CQL in one of the following ways

1.    As used before - it deletes column(s) or entire row(s)
2.    `TRUNCATE`: It deletes all rows from the table
3.    `USING TTL`: It sets time to live on column(s) within a row; after expiration of specified period, columns are automatically deleted by Cassandra.


Let's remove the actor with ID 99999999 we have just inserted before with a `DELETE`:

```
DELETE FROM movies.actor
WHERE actor_id = 99999999;
```

> **What you should see:** No output.

> **What just happened?** Cassandra marks the deleted data with a tombstone rather than immediately removing it; the actual removal happens during a background compaction process.

Let's see `USING TTL` in action  

```
INSERT INTO movies.actor (actor_id, name)
VALUES (99999998, 'An other actor')
USING TTL 120;
```

So, this test user will automatically be deleted after 120 seconds.

You can check the remaining TTL by using the function TTL on a column

```
SELECT TTL(name), actor_id, name
FROM movies.actor;
```

You can see that all the rows without a TTL return NULL, and the row we have added before returns the number of seconds left until the record is removed.

If you repeatedly execute that statement, you will see the TTL going down until the record is gone.

That finishes our work with static tables. In the next section we will see how we can use dynamic tables, which are much more interesting and important capability of Cassandra.

So far we have only stored information which static in a way that the number of columns we wanted to store by Movie and Actor are static during runtime. Of course we might from time to time extend the data model and might add new columns to an existing table. But this is a development task and can be done using an `ALTER TABLE xxxx ADD COLUMN ...` statement, as we know it from RDBMS.

## Using "Dynamic" Tables (wide row)

Dynamic Tables allow also growing to the side, so the number of columns are basically dynamic at runtime and ever row can have a different number of columns stored in the table / database.

So far our Movies and Actors which we have stored in the so-named static Cassandra table have no "relationships" to each-other. But of course an actor has played in many movies and a movie has many actors playing in it.

For storing this information, wide-row tables are the tool to use in Casandra.

### Create the "Movies by Actor" and "Actors by Movie" tables

Let's start with the Actor and the movies he has played in, which we call `movies_by_actor`.

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movies.movies_by_actor;
CREATE TABLE movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id int,
                movie_id int,  
                title text,
                PRIMARY KEY (actor_id, movie_id)
);
```

> **What you should see:** No error — the table is created silently.

> **What just happened?** Wide-row (dynamic) tables use composite keys where the partition key (`actor_id`) groups related rows together and the clustering column (`movie_id`) becomes part of the physical sort order on disk — enabling efficient range scans within a partition.

We use a name which reflects the query we can resolve using that table.

Now let's continue with the table to get the actors who have played in a given movie, which we call `actors_by_movie`

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movies.actors_by_movie;
CREATE TABLE movies.actors_by_movie (movie_id int,
             title text STATIC,
                actor_id int,  
                name text,
                PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, actor_id)
);
```

> **What you should see:** No error — the table is created silently.

### Inserting data to the two tables

Let's add some movies for given actors. Of course in real world they have played in much more movies, this is just a sample of movies for some of the actors which we have in the `actor` table. But not all of the movies we add here to the `movies_by_actor` table are in fact stored in the `movie` table. We can see, there are no foreign keys and nobody can stop us to add movies to that table which are not "known" to us / not stored also in the `movie` table.

```sql
// Movies for actor "Bruce Willis"

INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title)
VALUES (0000246, 0110912, 'Pulp Fiction');

INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title)
VALUES (0000246, 1606378, 'A Good Day to Die Hard');

INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title)
VALUES (0000246, 0217869, 'Unbreakable');

INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title)
VALUES (0000246, 0377917, 'The Fifth Element');

INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title)
VALUES (0000246, 0112864, 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance');

// Movies for actor "Keanu Reeves"

INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title)
VALUES (0000206, 0133093, 'The Matrix');

INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title)
VALUES (0000206, 0234215, 'The Matrix Reloaded');

INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title)
VALUES (0000206, 0111257, 'Speed');


// Movies for actor "Sandra Bullock"

INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title)
VALUES (0000113, 0111257, 'Speed');
```

> **What you should see:** Data inserted without errors — no output is returned for successful INSERTs.

> **What just happened?** Each insert writes a clustering row within the actor's partition. All movies for a given actor are stored together on the same node, ordered by `movie_id`, which makes retrieving all movies for an actor a single partition read.

Now let's also add some data to the `actors_by_movie` table. Again, not all of the actors we add here are also stored in the `movie` table. In real-world of course they would have to be in sync and when inserting the data this would have been taken care off.

```
// Actors for movie "The Matrix"

INSERT INTO movies.actors_by_movie (movie_id, title, actor_id, name)
VALUES (0133093, 'The Matrix', 0000206, 'Keanu Reeves');

INSERT INTO movies.actors_by_movie (movie_id, title, actor_id, name)
VALUES (0133093, 'The Matrix', 0000401, 'Laurence Fishburne');

INSERT INTO movies.actors_by_movie (movie_id, title, actor_id, name)
VALUES (0133093, 'The Matrix', 0005251, 'Carrie-Anne Moss');

INSERT INTO movies.actors_by_movie (movie_id, title, actor_id, name)
VALUES (0133093, 'The Matrix', 0915989, 'Hugo Weaving');


// Actors for movie "Pulp Fiction"

INSERT INTO movies.actors_by_movie (movie_id, title, actor_id, name)
VALUES (0110912, 'Pulp Fiction', 0000237, 'John Travolta');

INSERT INTO movies.actors_by_movie (movie_id, title, actor_id, name)
VALUES (0110912, 'Pulp Fiction', 0000168, 'Samuel L. Jackson');

INSERT INTO movies.actors_by_movie (movie_id, title, actor_id, name)
VALUES (0110912, 'Pulp Fiction', 0000246, 'Bruce Willis');
```

> **What you should see:** Data inserted without errors — no output is returned for successful INSERTs.

Now let's see these table in Action. First let's see all the movies "Bruce Willis" has played in.

```
SELECT title
FROM movies.movies_by_actor
WHERE actor_id = 0000246;
```

> **What you should see:** A result table listing the titles of all movies Bruce Willis has played in.

And now let's see the actors which played in the movie "Pulp Fiction"

```
SELECT name, title
FROM movies.actors_by_movie
WHERE movie_id = 0110912;
```

> **What you should see:** A result table listing the names and title for all actors who played in Pulp Fiction.

## Using Counter Columns

For the movie ratings table, we will be using a static table with some columns of type `COUNTER` so that we can easily count the number of stars we gave to each movie.  

Columns of type COUNTER cannot be mixed with other data types and therefore we have to create a new table cannot add these columns to the existing `movie` table.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movies.rating_by_movie;
CREATE TABLE movies.rating_by_movie (movie_id int,
             one_star counter,  
             two_star counter,  
             three_star counter,  
             four_star counter,  
             five_star counter,
                PRIMARY KEY (movie_id)
);
```

> **What you should see:** No error — the counter table is created silently.

Let's add some ratings for the movie "Pulp Fiction". With columns of type counter you have to use the `UPDATE` command and you can't use an `INSERT`.

```sql
UPDATE movies.rating_by_movie
SET five_star = five_star + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912;

UPDATE movies.rating_by_movie
SET four_star = four_star + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912;

UPDATE movies.rating_by_movie
SET five_star = five_star + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912;

UPDATE movies.rating_by_movie
SET five_star = five_star + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912;

UPDATE movies.rating_by_movie
SET two_star = two_star + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912;
```

> **What you should see:** No output.

> **What just happened?** Counter columns use a special CRDT-based data type — they can only be incremented or decremented, never set to an absolute value, to allow safe concurrent updates across replicas.

Check the current ratings for movie "Pulp Fiction"

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies.rating_by_movie WHERE movie_id = 0110912;
```

> **What you should see:** The result table showing the accumulated counter values for each star rating of Pulp Fiction.

Let's also create a table which counts the number of views per movie, separated by male and female viewers and per month.
In this case we create a wide-row table, with `movie_id` for the partition key and `year` and `month` as the clustering key. Additionally we decided to store the clustering columns in descending order by year and month, so that the latest view counts can be retrieved efficiently.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movies.movie_viewed_by_time;
CREATE TABLE movies.movie_viewed_by_time (movie_id int,
               year int,
               month int,
             male counter,
             female counter,
                PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, year, month)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (year DESC, month DESC);
```

> **What you should see:** No error — the wide-row counter table is created silently.

> **What just happened?** Wide-row tables use composite keys where the partition key (`movie_id`) groups related rows together and the clustering columns (`year`, `month`) become part of the physical sort order on disk — enabling efficient range scans.

Add some sample values to the new table for movie Pulp Fiction

```sql
// Pulp Fiction Views 2019/03
UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET male = male + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 03;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET male = male + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 03;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET female = female + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 03;

// Pulp Fiction Views 2019/04
UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET female = female + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 04;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET male = male + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 04;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET female = female + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 04;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET female = female + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 04;

// Pulp Fiction Views 2019/05
UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET male = male + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 05;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET male = male + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 05;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET female = female + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 05;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET female = female + 1
WHERE movie_id = 0110912 AND year = 2019 and month = 05;
```

> **What you should see:** No output.

Add some sample values to the new table for movie The Matrix

```sql
// The Matrix Views 2019/03
UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET male = male + 1
WHERE movie_id = 133093 AND year = 2019 and month = 03;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
SET male = male + 1
WHERE movie_id = 133093 AND year = 2019 and month = 03;

UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time

## Using the Python API with Cassandra

The `cassandra-driver` library is the official Python client for Apache Cassandra. In this section we will connect to Cassandra from the **Jupyter** environment and reproduce the same operations we performed with `cqlsh` — inserting movies and actors, querying wide-row tables, and incrementing counter columns.

Open a browser and navigate to <http://dataplatform:28888> and log in with token `abc123!`.

Create a new Python 3 notebook by clicking on the **Python 3 (ipykernel)** widget and work through the cells below in order.

### Cell 1 — Install the library

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install cassandra-driver
```

> **What you should see:** pip output ending with `Successfully installed cassandra-driver-...`.

### Cell 2 — Connect to Cassandra

```python
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
from cassandra.auth import PlainTextAuthProvider

auth = PlainTextAuthProvider(username='cassandra', password='cassandra')
cluster = Cluster(['cassandra-1'], port=9042, auth_provider=auth)
session = cluster.connect()

print(session.execute("SELECT release_version FROM system.local").one().release_version)
```

> **What you should see:** The Cassandra version string (e.g. `5.0.4`), confirming a successful connection.

### Cell 3 — Create the keyspace and tables

```python
session.execute("""

    session.execute(insert_actors_by_movie, row)

print("Wide-row data inserted.")
```

> **What you should see:** `Wide-row data inserted.`

### Cell 7 — Query data

```python
# All movies for Bruce Willis
rows = session.execute("SELECT title FROM movies.movies_by_actor WHERE actor_id = 246")
print("Bruce Willis filmography:")
for row in rows:
    print(f"  {row.title}")

print()

# All actors in Pulp Fiction

print("Pulp Fiction cast:")
for row in rows:
    print(f"  {row.name} — {row.title}")
```

```
Bruce Willis filmography:
  Pulp Fiction
  Die Hard: With a Vengeance
  The Fifth Element
  Unbreakable
  A Good Day to Die Hard

Pulp Fiction cast:
  Bruce Willis — Pulp Fiction
  John Travolta — Pulp Fiction
  Samuel L. Jackson — Pulp Fiction
```

> **What you should see:** Bruce Willis's filmography and the Pulp Fiction cast.
>
> **What just happened?** Both queries read from a single partition — all rows for a given `actor_id` or `movie_id` are co-located on the same node, making them extremely fast regardless of table size.

### Cell 8 — Fetch a full movie by primary key

```python
row = session.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM movies.movie WHERE movie_id = %s", (110912,)
).one()

print(f"Title:    {row.title}")
print(f"Year:     {row.release_year}")
print(f"Runtime:  {row.running_time} min")
print(f"Genres:   {', '.join(sorted(row.genres))}")
print(f"Rank:     {row.top250_rank}")
```

```
Title:    Pulp Fiction
Year:     1994
Runtime:  154 min
Genres:   Crime, Drama
Rank:     8
```

> **What you should see:** The Pulp Fiction record with all stored fields printed.

### Cell 9 — Counter columns (star ratings)

Counter columns can only be incremented or decremented — they cannot be set with `INSERT`.

```python
update_counter = session.prepare("""
    UPDATE movies.rating_by_movie
    SET five_star = five_star + 1
    WHERE movie_id = ?
""")

# Simulate 3 five-star votes for Pulp Fiction
for _ in range(3):
    session.execute(update_counter, (110912,))

# One four-star and one two-star vote
session.execute("UPDATE movies.rating_by_movie SET four_star = four_star + 1 WHERE movie_id = 110912")
session.execute("UPDATE movies.rating_by_movie SET two_star  = two_star  + 1 WHERE movie_id = 110912")

row = session.execute("SELECT * FROM movies.rating_by_movie WHERE movie_id = 110912").one()
print("Pulp Fiction ratings:")
print(f"  ★★★★★  {row.five_star}")
print(f"  ★★★★   {row.four_star}")
print(f"  ★★★    {row.three_star}")
print(f"  ★★     {row.two_star}")
print(f"  ★      {row.one_star}")
```

```
Pulp Fiction ratings:
  ★★★★★  3
  ★★★★   1
  ★★★    None
  ★★     1
  ★      None
```

> **What you should see:** The accumulated star counts for Pulp Fiction.
>
> **What just happened?** Counter columns use a CRDT-based merge strategy — increments from concurrent clients are automatically reconciled without conflicts, making them safe for distributed vote tallying.

### Cell 10 — Counter columns (view counts per month)

```python
update_views = session.prepare("""
    UPDATE movies.movie_viewed_by_time
    SET male = male + ?, female = female + ?
    WHERE movie_id = ? AND year = ? AND month = ?
""")

view_data = [
    # (male_delta, female_delta, movie_id, year, month)
    (2, 1, 110912, 2019, 3),
    (1, 3, 110912, 2019, 4),
    (2, 2, 110912, 2019, 5),
    (3, 2, 133093, 2019, 3),
    (2, 3, 133093, 2019, 4),
    (1, 2, 133093, 2019, 5),
]

for male, female, movie_id, year, month in view_data:
    session.execute(update_views, (male, female, movie_id, year, month))

# View counts for Pulp Fiction across all months (newest first)
rows = session.execute(
    "SELECT year, month, male, female FROM movies.movie_viewed_by_time WHERE movie_id = 110912"
)
print("Pulp Fiction view counts (newest first):")
print(f"  {'Year':>4}  {'Month':>5}  {'Male':>6}  {'Female':>7}")
for row in rows:
    print(f"  {row.year:>4}  {row.month:>5}  {row.male:>6}  {row.female:>7}")
```

```
Pulp Fiction view counts (newest first):
  Year  Month    Male   Female
  2019      5       2        2
  2019      4       1        3
  2019      3       2        1
```

> **What you should see:** Monthly view counts for Pulp Fiction returned in descending year/month order, as defined by the `CLUSTERING ORDER BY (year DESC, month DESC)` clause on the table.

### Cell 11 — Bulk insert with an unlogged batch

For loading many rows that share the same partition key, Cassandra **unlogged batches** reduce round trips by sending all writes in a single coordinator request.

```python
from cassandra.query import BatchStatement, BatchType

# Batch-insert all movies for Keanu Reeves in one request
batch = BatchStatement(batch_type=BatchType.UNLOGGED)

stmt = session.prepare("""
    INSERT INTO movies.movies_by_actor (actor_id, movie_id, title) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
""")

keanu_movies = [
    (206, 133093, 'The Matrix'),
    (206, 234215, 'The Matrix Reloaded'),
    (206, 111257, 'Speed'),
]

for row in keanu_movies:
    batch.add(stmt, row)

session.execute(batch)
print("Keanu Reeves filmography batch-inserted.")

rows = session.execute("SELECT title FROM movies.movies_by_actor WHERE actor_id = 206")
for row in rows:
    print(f"  {row.title}")
```

> **What you should see:** `Keanu Reeves filmography batch-inserted.` followed by the three movie titles.
>
> **What just happened?** An unlogged batch groups writes for the same partition into one coordinator request, reducing round trips. Unlike logged batches (which have atomicity overhead), unlogged batches are optimised purely for throughput.

### Cell 12 — Cleaning up

```python
session.execute("DROP KEYSPACE IF EXISTS movies")
cluster.shutdown()
print("Keyspace dropped and connection closed.")
```

> **What you should see:** `Keyspace dropped and connection closed.` — all workshop tables have been removed and the driver connection is released.
